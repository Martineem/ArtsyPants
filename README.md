# ArtsyPants

A simple project delivered as a first assignment in IT2810 Web development

The project is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with some jQuery. More specific documentation is provided in the application.

The code could have been a lot more optimalized in terms of copy-paste-usage and separation of script in an own script-file.
